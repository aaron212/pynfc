Pynfc - Python bindings for libnfc
==================================

Requirements
------------

libnfc >= 1.5.1
python >= 2.6 < 3.0



Installation
------------
Use distutils as normal:

python setup.py install


Examples
--------
examples/rfid/libnfc/
    mifareauth.py - Conducts simple mifare authentication.
    dump.py - Dumps the contents of a MIFARE Classic card (the keys needs to known in advance).


History
-------
v0.0.7__July 2012 - (Boris Mazic) Added a framework for reading from and writing to RFID cards 
        based on the Perl's libnfc binding by Xant. Repackaged everything in the rfid.libnfc 
        namespace. Updated some structures to reflect libnfc-1.5.1 layout.



Examples
--------

There is an example program included for conducting simple mifare authentication:

python mifareauth.py

Example output (bulk of the raw hex excised for space):

Connect to reader: True
Initialize Reader: True
Field Down: True
CRC False: True
Parity True: True
Field Up: True
key: A0A1A2A3A4A5
...
T -> R: A2 7F 33 EE
TR == Next(TN, 96): True
R -> T: 8F A4 FA D1
T -> R: CA 9E 73 93

This indicates that it successfully authenticated to the requested block.

Documentation
-------------

The pynfc bindings should offer an intuitive, yet pythonic way of calling the standard libnfc API.

The source code should feature document strings for all classes and objects, and the mifareauth example is commented.
The python interface creates an nfc object that loosely wraps the pdi reference.
As much as possible all libnfc commands are mirrored in the created nfc object.

Please note this is in early development, and as such does not implement the full range of features found in libnfc itself.
